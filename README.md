# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis
What factors influence customers to part ways with their existing service provider ?

Background on the problem analysis:
In the Telecom industry, Churn is important because it directly affects the service provider's profitability. Churn is the percentage of customers who leave the service provider. So, in order to maintain profitability, the service provider should find new customers. This is not feasible as the cost of acquiring new customers is high and difficult. But, instead service providers focus on retaining the customers, which is easier to do as it eliminates the excess costs associated with customer acquisition. This analysis is focused on finding the factors contributing to customer churn and predicting the customer churn.
