# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis
Exploring the factors contributing to customer churn and prediction of customer churn.

Background on the problem analysis:
In the Telecom industry, Churn is important because it directly affects your serviceâ€™s profitability. Churn is the percentage of customers who leave the service provider. So, in order to maintain profitability, the company should find new customers. This is not feasible as the cost of acquiring new customers is high and difficult. But, instead organizations focus on retaining the customers, which is easier to do as it eliminates the excess costs associated with customer acquisition.
